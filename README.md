# COMDOCK Index Backend

Comdock Index is a web application that allows you to view simulated **fake** company informations, similar to what you would find in applications such as [NorthData](https://www.northdata.com/) or the German Websites [unternehmensregister.de](https://www.unternehmensregister.de/ureg/?submitaction=language&language=en) and [handelsregister.de](https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/welcome.xhtml) for real informations.

The backend of COMDOCK Index is developed using Strapi and can be found in this repository. You can find the frontend's Repo at [comdock-frontend](https://github.com/onissen/comdock-frontend).

## DISCLAIMER
The resulting web application and its contents of this repository are in many parts very similar to the official websites and entries into the german company register. It is expressly pointed out that all contents of this website in live state and into this repository are entirely fictitious. Any similarities in company names or connections to real existing persons and companies are purely coincidental and do not correspond to reality.

The contents of the website should be inserted exclusively through an external database. If you still find data into the code of this repository that does not seem to serve the basic structure of the website, please report by an [issue](https://github.com/onissen/comdock-backend/issues) into this repository. Even if you find parts of the code that do not seem to be intended for the public despite our previous review (such as access data or other backdoors), please [report](https://github.com/onissen/comdock-backend/issues) them as an issue to the repository owner. Thank you!
